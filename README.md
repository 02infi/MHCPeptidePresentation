# MHC Peptide Presentation
Peptides are brief sequences of amino acids that may be displayed on the cell surface by Major
Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) proteins. MHC Class I (MHC1) proteins, which are prevalent
on the surface of most cells, present peptides to T cells of the immune system, allowing for the
surveillance of cells for signs of infection or abnormal activity. The generation of MHC1 proteins is
influenced by genetic variations in the MHC1 genes, known as alleles, and each individual
possesses a unique set of MHC1 proteins. The wide array of MHC1 proteins across individuals
enables the immune system to recognize a diverse range of potential threats. Identifying the specific
peptides displayed by MHC proteins is crucial for the development of immunotherapies that can
stimulate the immune system to target cancer cells. By targeting specific peptides with
immunotherapies, the immune system can distinguish and attack cancer cells while leaving healthy
cells unharmed. This approach may prove to be more effective and less toxic than conventional
cancer treatments. To this end, this repo consists of a proposed ensemble based classifier that can predict if a
given peptide will be presented by a specific MHC1 protein, identified by its allele name.
